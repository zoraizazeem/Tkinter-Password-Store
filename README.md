# Tkinter-Password-Store
Password Store App with UI

App created with store and in built rudementary encryption. Tkinter library used for front end UI.

You can also use this app, just initially find the encrypted values of you passwords and usernames, in a .csv file stored locally.
I myself have the executable (using py installer) on my computer and this app is very useful for someone who keeps forgetting their passwords :).
