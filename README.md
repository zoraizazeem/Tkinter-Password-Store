# Tkinter-Password-Store
Password Store App with UI

App created with store and in built rudementary encryption. Tkinter library used for front end UI.

You can also use this app, just find the encrypted values of your passwords and usernames, store these into a .csv file stored locally as "Passwords". 
I myself have the executable (using pyinstaller https://www.pyinstaller.org) on my computer and this app is very useful for someone who keeps forgetting their passwords :).
